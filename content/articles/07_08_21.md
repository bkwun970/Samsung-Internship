# Vue Basics


### Declarative Rendering
Declarative rendering in Vue enables us to render data to the DOM using straightforward template syntax.
Double curly braces are used as placeholders to interpolate the required data in the DOM.

### V-Bind directive

Directives are prefixed with v- to indicate that they are special attributes provided by Vue Native, which internal bind with the React Native props.

Then-as you may have guessed-they apply special reactive behavior in re-rendering. 
Here, it is basically saying “keep this element’s title attribute up-to-date with the message property on the Vue instance.”

template is where HTML code blocks live

putting frog components into screen 

script section is where javascript code blocks live

+ it's the place where we import vue components by using import keyword

style is where CSS code blocks live.
And we basically set & color our boxes or etc.
