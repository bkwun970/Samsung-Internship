# Single File Component

Single File Components allow us to define the HTML/CSS and JS of a component all within a single .vue file.

A single-file component is composed of three parts:

* The template section which contains the componentâ€™s markup in plain HTML.
* The script section which contains all the JS logic within that component.
* The style section which contains all the component styles.
